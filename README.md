* I mostly use Javascript for web apps and Python for tools.
* I picked up C++ and C via the use of Arduinos and have been self-taught otherwise.
* I enjoy functional, homoiconic, and object-oriented langauges (especially Scheme) but have not had much experience using Scheme or Lisp. I'm trying to design one of my own but it's not going well.
* I have a [blog](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/) that I occasionally write stuff on. ![](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dragoncoder047/blog)
* I am a high school student so I will probably be busy with classes during the day. And homework in the evening. (You know, AP classes and stuff.)
* I am a member of the [Conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums) under the username **wirehead**. Half of what I do here somehow manages to wind up there as well (mostly from my [ca-experiments](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ca-experiments) repository).

*Note: I excluded Javascript from the above language stats because its verbosity (curly braces, JSDoc comments, etc.) compared to other languages artificially inflates the amount of Javascript I seem to have written. Only about 60% of those lines are meaningful code.*
