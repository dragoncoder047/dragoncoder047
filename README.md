I mostly do Javascript and Python stuff.
    
I do know a bit of C++ via the use of Arduinos.

## Projects I'm working on

* [Phoo](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/phoo) - a programming language *WIP - currently broken*
* [Thuepaste](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/thuepaste) determining the probablility of whether an arbitrary Thue program will halt *WIP*
* ....aaaand that's it so far :) Check back later!
