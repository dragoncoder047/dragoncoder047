I mostly do Javascript and Python stuff.
    
I picked up C++ and C via the use of Arduinos.

I have a [blog](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/) that I occasionally write stuff on.

I am a high school student so I will probably be busy with classes during the day. And homework in the evening. (You know, AP classes and stuff.)

I am a member of the [Conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums) under the username **wirehead**. Half of what I do here somehow manages to wind up there as well (mostly from my [ca-experiments](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ca-experiments) repository).

## Major projects I'm working on:

Disclaimer: contrary to what the above image says, I have never actually written any Forth. I *have* written some Phoo and TEHSSL (as well as the interpreters for those languages), which, being concatenative languages, I set Linguist to recognize them as Forth.
