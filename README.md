* I mostly use Javascript for web apps and Python for tools.
* I picked up C++ and C via the use of Arduinos and have been self-taught otherwise.
* I enjoy functional, homoiconic, and object-oriented langauges (especially Scheme) but have not had much experience using Scheme or Lisp. I'm trying to design one of my own but so far it's all just theoretical.
* I have a [blog](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/?utm_source=githubprofile) that I occasionally write stuff on. ![](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dragoncoder047/blog)
* I am a member of the [Conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums) under the username **wirehead**.
* I have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@dragoncoder047?si=LeWERFFGmZtFv3U-) -- check that out when you get a chance.

#### Some of my projects

* [Lynx](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/lynx) - A browser-based reactive programming toolkit with Scheme-based syntax. [Web editor](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/lynx)
* [Schemascii](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/schemascii) - A Python program to convert ASCII art circuit diagrams into nice SVG schematics.
* [Cogni](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/cogni) - An interpreter for the [Cognate](https://cognate-lang.github.io/) programming language that doesn't compile to C first.
* [uLisp fork](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ulisp-esp32) - My fork of [uLisp](http://ulisp.com/) with new, experimental features.
* [Langton-Music](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/langton-music) - A simulator for [musical Langton's Ant](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/langton-music?utm_source=githubprofile).
* [Armdroid 1000](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/armdroid) - A website about the old [Armdroid 1000](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/armdroid?utm_source=githubprofile) with a bunch of resources (manual, circuit diagram, photos, miscallaneous reverse-engineering, etc). 

#### Noteworthy but incomplete/WIP stuff

* [Parasite](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/parasite) - A game that can't be beaten by the player: you have to teach the NPC's how to play it for you.
* [PICKLE](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/pickle) and [Tinobsy](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/tinobsy) - A new idea for a programming language, and a type system to implement it.

*Note: I excluded Javascript from the above language stats because its verbosity (curly braces, JSDoc comments, etc.) compared to other languages artificially inflates the amount of Javascript I seem to have written. Only about 60% of those lines are meaningful code.*
