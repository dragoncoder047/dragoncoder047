I mostly do Javascript and Python stuff.
    
I do know a bit of C++ via the use of Arduinos.

I have a [blog](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/) that I occasionally write stuff on.

I am a high school student so I will probably be busy with classes during the day. And homework in the evening. (You know, AP classes and stuff.)

I am a member of the [Conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums) under the username **wirehead**. Half of what I do here somehow manages to wind up there as well (mostly from my [ca-experiments](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ca-experiments) repository).
