I mostly do Javascript and Python stuff.
    
I do know a bit of C++ via the use of Arduinos.

I have a [blog](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/blog/) that I occasionally write stuff on.

I am a high school student so I will probably be busy with classes during the day. And homework in the evening. (You know, AP classes and stuff.)

I am a member of the [Conwaylife.com forums](https://conwaylife.com/forums) under the username **wirehead**. Half of what I do here somehow manages to wind up there as well (mostly from my [ca-experiments](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ca-experiments) repository).

## Important stuff I've done or am doing

* [Phoo](https://github.com/phoo-lang/phoo) - a stack-based programming language. (Currently semi-broken; help would be appreciated if you know Javascript and/or Forth)
* A website about the [Armdroid 1000](https://dragoncoder047.github.io/armdroid) with a bunch of resources (manual, circuit diagram, photos, miscallaneous reverse-engineering, etc)
* Adding a whole bunch of [patches and modifications](https://github.com/dragoncoder047/ulisp-esp32) to David Johnson-Davies' **uLisp** interpreter for Arduinos (Dave Astels, if you're reading this, your help would be [much appreciated](https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-esp/issues/56#issuecomment-1221358270)!)
